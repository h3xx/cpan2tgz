NAME
       cpan2tgz - create Slackware GNU/Linux packages from CPAN
       Perl module distributions

SYNOPSIS
       cpan2tgz [option(s)] [module(s)]

       options: [--recursive] [--ignoreinstalled] [--install]
       [--pkgdir]

DESCRIPTION
       cpan2tgz is a tool to create Slackware GNU/Linux packages
       from CPAN Perl module distributions.  cpan2tgz was
       inspired by cpan2rpm.

OPTIONS
       --recursive
           This will build required module(s) and install them
           (if --install is specificed) as it traverses the
           dependency tree of the specified Perl module(s).  This
           can be dangerous.  It might be best to install one at
           a time.

       --ignoreinstalled
           This option specifies to build packages for required
           modules even if the module is found to be present and
           installed on the system.  This only works in conjunc\uffff
           tion with --recursive.

       --install
           Always install the generated package(s).  This is use\uffff
           ful with --recursive to satisfy dependencies.

       --pkgdir
           This option specifies the final location to place the
           generated package(s).  Defaults to /usr/src.

       module(s)
           A series of Perl modules to install, ie Data::Dumper

NOTES
       cpan2tgz uses the CPAN Perl module.  A working CPAN/Con\uffff
       fig.pm is assumed.  If CPAN has not been initialized prior
       to running cpan2tgz, it will be initialized on the first
       run.
