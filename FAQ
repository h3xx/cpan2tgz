1.  What is cpan2tgz?

 cpan2tgz is a program to create Slackware packages from CPAN distributions.


2.  Where are the created packages placed?

 Created packages are placed in /usr/src/ by default, or in the location
 specified by --pkgdir.


3.  How do I build prerequisite modules automatically?

 Use the --recursive along with the --install command line options.  This will
 install the generated packages in order to satisfy dependencies as packages
 are built.


4.  Why do I get "cc: not found" when I build modules?

 Try symlinking /usr/bin/gcc to /usr/bin/cc.


5.  Can I use it to update all the installed Perl modules?

 No, but from the CPAN pod:

   # install everything that is outdated on my disk:
   perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install(CPAN::Shell->r)'
   # or to see just the versions that have updates
   perl -e 'use CPAN; CPAN::Shell->r;'


6.  Why doesn't this work on Slackware 9.1 and below?

 cpan2tgz requires the ExtUtils::MakeMaker package support DESTDIR.  Upgrading
 ExtUtils::MakeMaker manually seems to take care of this.
