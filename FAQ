1.  What is cpan2tgz?

 cpan2tgz is a program to create slackware packages from CPAN distributions.


2.  Where are the created packages placed?

 Created packages are placed in /usr/src/.

 Use the --recursive command line option.  This will install the generated
 packages in order to satisfy dependencies as packages are built.


4.  Why do I get "cc: not found" when I build modules?

 Try symlinking /usr/bin/gcc to /usr/bin/cc.

5.  Why do I get a make ERROR when it tries to install perl-5.x.x?
