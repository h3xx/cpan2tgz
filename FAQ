1.  What is cpan2tgz?

 cpan2tgz is a program to create slackware packages from CPAN distributions.


2.  Where are the created packages placed?

 Created packages are placed in /usr/src/.


3.  How do I build prerequisite modules automatically?

 Use the --recursive command line option.  This will install the generated
 packages in order to satisfy dependencies as packages are built.


4.  Why do I get "cc: not found" when I build modules?

 Try symlinking /usr/bin/gcc to /usr/bin/cc.


5.  Why do I get a make ERROR when it tries to install perl-5.x.x?

6.  Can I use it to update all the installed Perl modules?

 No, but from the CPAN pod:

   # install everything that is outdated on my disk:
   perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install(CPAN::Shell->r)'
   # or to see just the versions that have updates
   perl -e 'use CPAN; CPAN::Shell->r;'
