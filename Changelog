 * fixed slack-required generated list to show the actual package names as
   created, like perl-timedate instead of perl-date-parse and perl-time-zone
 * fixed bug where -ignoreinstalled was being ignored
 * enforced that the same package cannot be handled twice in one session,
   which causes CPAN.pm to complain and abort.
 * -recursive now only installs the module when --install is specified
 * inverted meaning of ignoreinstalled, so now ignoreinstalled will build
   up to date packages for modules already present on the system
 * added check to skip dependency when required module is contained within the
   Perl source
 * generate the doinst.sh to fix perllocal.pod by concatenating it's contents
   from doinst.sh and removing it from the build directory before the pkg is made
 * fixed dependency names for Perl modules to follow perl-${module/::/-}
 * always list perl as a dependency in generated package
 * formatting updates of system() calls
